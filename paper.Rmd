# ABSTRACT

R packages are the staple of an R programmer’s effectiveness. Since R is an open
source language with a robust package (extension) framework, “Base R” (R with no
packages) can be relatively featureless. However, add the CRAN package network
of 12,000 packages (and growing), and the R programmer instantly becomes
enormously efficient and powerful. It raises an immediate question, though: How
do we use those open source packages in a reliable and reproducible way? We will
discuss best practices for managing packages as an individual developer and as
an enterprise. If we can do this successfully, we will establish a firm
foundation on which to build reliable results.

# INTRODUCTION

The R package ecosystem extends the R programming language in just about any
direction imaginable. It enables and empowers the open source community
surrounding R to collaborate and contribute to collective improvements that all
users can share. These packages simplify (among other things) the process of
fitting models, analyzing data, logging, visualizing, adding emojis, creating
user interfaces, building REST APIs, and munging spreadsheets.

In fact, the R package ecosystem might be _the_ most valuable part of the R
programming language. Packages are shared most often via the "Comprehensive R
Archive Network" (CRAN), but also via GitHub, BioConductor and RForge.

With over 12,000 such packages, the R programmer's toolbelt is enormously
varied and she can be incredible effective as a result. However, this vibrant
ecosystem does not come without its risks, so the _way_ in which these
packages are managed by a researcher is important for 

# WHY R PACKAGES

The first question a security minded or IT staff person might ask, though, is _why_? Why expose yourself to the risk of using an open source package that
might break unexpectedly, have a security vulnerability, or do something
subtly incorrect? Would not R _by itself_ be much more reliable, reproducible,
and secure?

These are valid and immensely valuable questions. We would answer on several 
fronts:

- The R package ecosystem contains decades or centuries of collective software
engineering, research, and algorithm optimization. To omit this work from
your toolbelt without inquiry is to epitomize re-inventing the wheel
- Not all packages are created equal. Some are fringe experiments or pet
projects and are not fitting for reproducible research. Likewise, others are
serious software engineering funded by reputable organizations or maintained
by renown programmers.
- R packages have _standards._ `R CMD CHECK`, as well as many of `CRAN`'s checks
help validate that an R package does not have certain types of illicit,
insecure, or dangerous behavior.
- R packages thrive in a community of open source contributors who are vetting,
testing, validating, and improving algorithms and processes. Such a community is
far more effective and thorough than any CI pipeline.

Suffice it to say that R packages are desirable to the R programmer, and we will
assume this for the rest of our work. However, the concerns above must still be
addressed, and we will propose best practices for addressing these concerns.

## AN ANALOGY

Let us imagine a chef who is working for a five-star restaurant. This chef
creates remarkable meals in his kitchen and becomes renown for his work.
We might guess that this chef cares _very much_ about where he gets his
ingredients from, as the ingredients are integral to his dishes. Further,
this chef will care very much _more_ about his ingredients and spend much
more time examining and understanding them than the average person.

In our analogy, the chef is a researcher and his dishes are his research. His
ingredients are the R packages that support and facilitate his work. He has a
distributor that he gets his ingredients from, and then he has "best practices"
for his management of the ingredients when they arrive in his kitchen.
